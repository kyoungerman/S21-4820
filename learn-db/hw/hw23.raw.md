m4_include(setup.m4)

# Interactive - 23 - with - pre-selects to do stuff.

You can run queries before your main query and give the results names.
These are run in order and that can have substantial advantages.

The general syntax is

```
with
	temp_name as ( select ... )

select stufff.

	from  temp_name

;
```

```
m4_include(hw23_1.sql)
```


You should get back a single row of data that tells you that in Wyoming you get 43% as much pay
as a job in NY or NJ (Note that the data in this example is not totally accurate.  Also you have
a much lower cost of living in Wyoming than you do in NY NY.)
