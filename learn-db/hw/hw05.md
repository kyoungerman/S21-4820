# Interactive - 05 - insert more data / select unique data

Let's put in some more data - that has some mistakes in it.


```
INSERT INTO name_list values
	( 'Liz Trubune',         30, 'WY' ),
	( 'Jane True',           20, 'WY' ),
	( 'Lary Smith',          58, 'NJ' ),
	( 'Dave Dave',           21, 'NJ' ),
	( 'Laura Ann Alkinoos',  34, 'PA' )
;


```

The problem is that "Jane True" is now a duplicate!

Let's see it.

```

SELECT * from name_list;


```

We will get how to prevent this later.
Right now let's get unique data back when the
actual data has duplicates.   For lots of reasons you 
can get duplicates in a set of selected data.

```
SELECT distinct * from name_list;

```

Book: pages 12 to 14.
