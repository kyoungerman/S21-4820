# Interactive - 01 - Create Table

Create a table with 3 columns.  The table name will be "name_list".
The columns are:

- real_name a text column
- age an integer
- state a 2 character field for a US state code.

```
create table <name> (
	<column>,	
	<column>,	
	<column>,	
	...
	<column>
);
```
The columns are a comma `,` separated list.   The set of
columns tars with a `(` and ends with a `)`.

A `;` (semicolon) is used to mark the end of the statement.

Officially this is call the Data Definition Language or DDL.

We have to declare what we want to store before storing it.

We will get back to data-types and SQL in a future homework.

so with 3 columns

```
m4_include(hw01_1.sql)
```
