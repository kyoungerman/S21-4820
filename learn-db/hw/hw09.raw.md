# Interactive - 09 - add a table with state codes

A check constraint on all the state codes would be very long.   There are also
times when that is just not the best way to check that a value is correct.

There is a different way to check that a value is in a range of values.
That is to add a new table that contains all the values and have the
database verify that new values are in this list.

First let's create the table with the values.  We can also have the
database verify that nobody puts in an empty state name.  This is
the "NOT NULL" on each of the types.

```
m4_include(hw09_1.sql)
```

We will also need an index on the state code so that we can
reference it.


```
m4_include(hw09_2.sql)
```

Then we need to populate the state table with states.  Please cut-and-paste
this or use the supplied file to insert the states.

```
m4_include(hw09_3.sql)
```

Now let's make the relationship between them know to the database.
This is called a foreign key constraint.

```
m4_include(hw09_4.sql)
```

Now when we try to insert data that is has an invalid state code
into our list of names it will get rejected.

The following SQL will *not* run successfully

```
insert into name_list ( real_name, state ) values
	( 'nobody', 'XX' )
;
```

You should get an error that looks similar to:

```
ERROR:  insert or update on table "name_list" violates foreign key constraint "name_list_state_fk"
DETAIL:  Key (state)=(XX) is not present in table "us_state".
```
