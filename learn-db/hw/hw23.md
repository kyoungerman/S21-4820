# Interactive - 23 - with - pre-selects to do stuff.

You can run queries before your main query and give the results names.
These are run in order and that can have substantial advantages.

The general syntax is

```
with
	temp_name as ( select ... )

select stufff.

	from  temp_name

;
```

```
WITH
	mystery_employess as ( select sum(pay) total_pay  from name_list where state = 'WY' ),
	normal_employees as ( select sum(pay) total_pay from name_list where state in ( 'NJ', 'NY' ) )
SELECT round( ( tWY.total_pay / ( tWY.total_pay + tEast.total_pay ) ) * 100.0, 2)  as relative_pay
FROM 
	mystery_employess  as tWY
	, normal_employees  as tEast
;

```


You should get back a single row of data that tells you that in Wyoming you get 43% as much pay
as a job in NY or NJ (Note that the data in this example is not totally accurate.  Also you have
a much lower cost of living in Wyoming than you do in NY NY.)
