# Interactive - 24 - truncate table

PostgreSQL (and most other SQL databases, Oracle, DB/2, DB/2 Universal etc)
provide the ability to discard ALL the data in a table.     This is implemented
as a re-write of the table header info and putting all the data in the table
on the re-claim block list.  So it is linear time(fast).

Also it is a part of the Data Definition Language (not Data Manipulation)
so it often can not be used in a transaction.  It can not be rolled back
if the transaction fails.

Also when you use truncate stuff like triggers for delete will not fire.

```
TRUNCATE TABLE name_list;
SELECT count(1) from name_list;

```

You should get back 0 rows.
