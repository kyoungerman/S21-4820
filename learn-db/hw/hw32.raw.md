# Interactive - 32 - only one a fixed set of rows.		(pre-papulae with key, pk, check-constraint on key)

There is a different way to implement a set of configuration items.  In this case the items
are stored one in each row in a set of fixed rows.


```
m4_include(hw32_1.sql)
```

With a table like this we can insert some values:

```
m4_include(hw32_2.sql)
```

The fixed set of configuration items is checked with the check constraint
and the unique key on name.

A trigger can be used to prevent deletion of items.

```
m4_include(hw32_5.sql)
```
