# Interactive - 12 - fix our duplicate data

Now that we have a unique primary key we can fix the duplicate name and its row.

```
m4_include(hw12_1.sql)
```

This shows us 2 rows and we would like to delete just one of them.  Without the unique
primary key this is really hard to do.  With the key we can delete one of the two rows.

This makes for a complex query.   First let's select the UUID column, name_list_id
where the duplicate is.


```
m4_include(hw12_2.sql)
```

Now let's just select 1 of the IDs. To do this we have to convert the UUID to text,
that is the `::text` so that we can use a function `min()` on it.  This is kind of
a random pick - but it will give us just 1 UUID.


```
m4_include(hw12_3.sql)
```

Now we can delete and skip over the 1 UUID that we picked from above.  This is
the `not in` portion - where we put a select inside the delete.


```
m4_include(hw12_4.sql)
```

Now select again and we have removed the duplicate.

```
m4_include(hw12_1.sql)
```
