# Interactive - 14 - data types

This is really the stuff from chapter 3 in the book.

When we create a table,  ( Already created in the last homework when you ran the file )

```
CREATE TABLE us_state (
	state_id UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
	state_name text NOT NULL,
	state char varying (2) NOT NULL,
	FIPS_code char varying (2) NOT NULL,
	area_rank int not null default 9999,
	area_sq_mi numeric not null default 0
);

```

we specify that the columns have a "type" and constraints on the data.

The most common set of types are (ordered from my own code on how frequently I use each type):

| Type               | Description                                                           |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| text               | a string of 0 or more characters.                                     |
| varchar(n)         | a string of 0 to `n` characters.                                      |
| uuid               | a UUID.                                                               |
| date               | a date - not a time.                                                  |
| time               | a time value.                                                         |
| bigint, int8       | 8 byte integer                                                        |
| timestamp          | a date and a time - usually with a time zone.                         |
| numeric            | a large number with (think 130k digits, before/after decimal point)   |
| decimal            | a large number with (think 130k digits, before/after decimal point)   |
| float              | 4 byte - a floating point number with an exponent                     |
| real               | 4 byte - a floating point number with an exponent                     |
| json, jsonb        | JSON data                                                             |
| double precision   | 8 byte - a floating point number with an exponent                     |
| bit, varbit        | variable length bit string values                                     |
| serial             | a 4 byte auto-generated integer that counts up                        |
| interval           | a time interval can be +/- 178million years                           |
| bytea              | byte array - binary data                                              |
| boolean            | true/false                                                            |
| point, line        | geometric data                                                        |
| box, path          | geometric data                                                        |
| polygon, cirlce    | geometric data                                                        |
| tvector, tsquery   | full text search type                                                 |
| inet, cidr         | interget address tyeps, IPv4 122.4.3.22 or IPV6                       |
| user defined tyeps | The type system is extensible!                                        |
	

Also there is a Geographic Information Package for PostgreSQL that is very good.
It is built on top of the geometric data types and GIN indexes.   

We are not going to use all of these types.  Just a few of the most common ones like timestamp.

Often we want a column to show when a new row is inserted or updated in a table.
Let's add these to our name_list table.

```
alter table name_list add updated timestamp ;
alter table name_list add created timestamp 
	default current_timestamp not null  ;

```

To make the 'updated' column work we need have PostgreSQL run some
code when an update happens.  This kind of a thing is called a "trigger".

Let's add a trigger to the table.  
Run the file `hw14_2.sql`.  The contents of the file is shown below.


```

CREATE OR REPLACE function name_list_upd()
RETURNS trigger AS 
$$
BEGIN
  NEW.updated := current_timestamp;
  RETURN NEW;
END
$$
LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';


CREATE TRIGGER name_list_trig
BEFORE update ON name_list
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE name_list_upd();


```


Now when we do an update on this table it will set the updated field
to the current time.
