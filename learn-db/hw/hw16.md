# Interactive - 16 - count matching rows in a select

You can count stuff that is grouped.   This turns out to be very useful.

Suppose that we want to know how many states are in a group and the
sum of the population in the group.

```
SELECT 
		fed_area,
		round(avg(gdp_growth)::numeric,2)::text||'%' as avg_growth,
		sum(population) as sum_population,
		count(state) as no_of_states,
		string_agg(state, ',' ORDER BY state) as  state_list
	FROM us_state
	GROUP BY fed_area
	ORDER BY 2 desc
;

```

You should get 12 rows order by decreasing average growth.




## Take Away

1. You can count the number of rows in the group with count.
2. You can order by a column position this is the "2 desc".
3. The function round() takes a numeric argument - but the output of avg() is a double precision float.  A type cast is used.
4. You can convert from the numeric result of round to text with a "::text" type cast - then add the '%' to show it is a percentage.
