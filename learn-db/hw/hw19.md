# Interactive - 19 - select using sub-query and exists

Let's use some of our joins to delete some data.

Let's get rid of the people that are not in a department.

```
SELECT t0.name as "Employee Name", t0.dept_name as "Department Name", t0.pay "Year Pay"
FROM  (
		SELECT t1.name, t2.dept_name, t1.pay, t1.employee_id
		FROM employee as t1
			LEFT OUTER join department as t2 on ( t1.department_id = t2.department_id )
		WHERE t1.department_id is null
		ORDER BY 1, 3 desc, 4
	) as t0
;

```

You should get back 2 rows.

These rows should be the offending rows with the department-less employees.
