# Legal and Backups

## Legal requirements for backups

According to the American Management Association:
"About 50% of businesses that suffer from a major disaster without
a disaster recovery plan in place, never re-open for business."

### Fiduciary Responsibility

Fiduciary Responsibility is the responsibility that corporate officers have to investors.

"... the SEC has proposed a new Rule 206(4)-4, which would make it unlawful to provide advisory services to clients
unless the RIA has a business continuity and transition plan (that is reviewed at least annually). In fact, the SEC has
stated that it views having a business continuity plan as essential for an advisor to fulfill their fiduciary duty; or
viewed another way, the firm that isn’t prepared for a business disruption isn’t prepared to fulfill its fiduciary
duty to clients."  (Rule has been approved)

From: https://www.kitces.com/blog/sec-rule-2064-4-requiring-ria-business-continuity-plan-bcp-and-transition-plan/

Even though the rule has not been finalized the SEC expects companies to have robust business continuity plans
in place as a part of fiduciary obligation.

Disruption can be in may forms.  Floods, Fires, Earthquakes, Global Warming - or - just the death or disability
of key personnel.


### Legal responsibility due to contracts and SaaS

Two Parts

1. Who are your vendors - and do they have business continuity plans in place.
2. Who are your customers - do you have financial services companies, health companies, US or Foreign?

### Backups fit into a "business continuity" Plan

1. Remember that business continuity includes -
	1. Loss of key personnel (because they quit, or ghost you)
	2. Death of personnel
	3. Natural Disaster ( flood, earthquake, fire etc ) 
	4. Non-Natural disaster - loss of power, network interruption ( Back Hoe and Squirrels )

What will a plan include:

In each type of interruption, your plan should consist of:

- Step by Step process - list of contacts - list of responsibilities for each person
- Backup persons for each person
- Procedures that anticipate different scenarios

#### Short term / temporary interruption

How do you get a temporary interruption - internet failure, power loss, phone loss

Consider The Following:

- Backup and recovery of records
- Alternate means of communicating with customers - think backup website / backup email / SMS etc.

What happens when what seems to be a temporal interruption becomes a longer term problem?

#### Extended Interruption

How about when you have to relocate, replace systems, replace a primary vendor - or when you have
malicious destruction of data or systems?  Fire, Flood, Earthquake are also examples.

An extended interruption occurs when a firm has to relocate or replace office property or records due to destruction. An
extended interruption could occur in the event of a fire, floor, or other natural disaster. Your firm's BCP should
address an extended interruption similar to a temporary interruption with a few additional considerations. 

Consider The Following:

- Replacement of equipment - like serves - or vendors that provide servers
- Move of "owned" or "leased" equipment with virtual services (even if they cost more)
- Do your employees have the ability to work from home or from a remote location?
- Do your vendors have a business continuity plan?
- Can you connect to databases and servers from outside of the "office"?
- Do you have a reachability plan for all staph?

#### Permanent Interruption

Lots of forms of permanent interruption - but do be aware that fires kill 82% of small businesses (less than 500
employees) - Floods are just about as bad.   Criminal fraud.  Death or disability of key players in a business.
Is a "succession" plan in place? 

Consider The Following:

- Who will take over - who will data / IP be transferred to?
- Who will handle dissolution of the company?
- Backups of financial data are still required for 7 to 8 years - IRS 206 rule.
- Will clients be moved to some other service?

## Legal Responsibility

Database Administrators face the very real risk include:

- Data Lost or compromised.  This is probably the biggest item.  The data is under the care of the DBA and now it is gone / messed up etc.  If you combine this with SaaS the clients are in a position to sue.  If the business is
not carying Errors & Omissions Insurance the liability can be transferred to you.  This is especially true if you have failed in your professional duties.
- Data Breach - the data is there but hackers have now.  Protection of proprietary business information is part of the picture.  Sensitive customer information, credit cards, passwords ... is a 2nd part.  Cyber Liability Insurance can
help cover the financial fallout.
- Employee malfeasance.  If any financial institutions are involved then a Fidelity Bond insurance should be purchased.
- Physical Theft.  If servers get stolen then access to the systems has been compromised.  Both Business Owner's Policy and Liability Insurance are needed.

## Normal tests for Backup / Continuity

- Annual tests of backup plan
- Test for different types of disruption
- Verify availability of backup equipment
- Have both electronic and written(printed) versions of action plan
- Very that critical employees have copies of the plan
